AI-Enhanced-Spam-Detection-and-Filtering-Solutions

📌 Project Overview This project implements an AI-powered spam detection and filtering solution using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning algorithms. It classifies text messages into spam and ham (non-spam) categories efficiently, supporting future integration with email and messaging platforms to enhance security and user experience. This is an AI-powered spam detection project made by Priyankar for advanced NLP deployment.

🚀 Features

Real-time spam classification
Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming)
User-friendly deployment via Streamlit
Pre-trained Multinomial Naive Bayes model
Clean and modular code structure for easy integration with larger systems
